# harbour
The Durban harbor control requires a concurrency safe application that will help the staff control the flow of boats and ships into the harbor. • The harbor has a perimeter of 10km between the dock, and the open sea. • The harbor can only allow one boat into the perimeter at a time. • Any boat that enters the perimeter will complete the 10km journey into the harbor before it reaches the dock. • No other boat may enter the 10km perimeter once a boat is inside the perimeter. • Boats arrive at the perimeter randomly. • All boats that arrive at the perimeter must wait at the 10km perimeter line before they are ordered to ender the perimeter by harbor control. • There are 3 types of boats: o Speedboat ▪ Speed: 30km/h o Sailboat ▪ Speed: 15km/h o Cargo ship ▪ Speed: 5km/h • These types of boats can arrive at the perimeter at any time. • Once the boat in the perimeter has completed the 10km journey and docked, a boat waiting at the perimeter may enter. • Snapshot example: o There are 2 speedboats and a Sailboat at the perimeter o There is one Cargo ship inside the perimeter o The 2 speedboats and sailboat need to wait for the cargo ship to reach the dock before harbor control can signal one of them to enter the perimeter.
